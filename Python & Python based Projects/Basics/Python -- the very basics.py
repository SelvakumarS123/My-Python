# think of the milk and tea example--> you will need a third cup to inter change the contents of two cups(milk and tea)
# 1. pour milk(a) into the new cup
# 2. pour  tea(b) into empty a(milk cup)
# 3. pour milk(which now is in c) into b(which is now empty)
# 4. interchange = done


# variable name rules:
# 1. 3length-->wrong   length3--> correct
# 2. user name-->wrong    user_name--> correct
